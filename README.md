- **Web & Mobile Support:** Available on both **React.js (Web)** and **React Native (Mobile)**.
- **Offline Mode:** Downloadable lessons for students with limited internet access.
- **Interactive Learning Modules:** Engaging lessons, quizzes, and real-time progress tracking.
- **Community Digital Hubs:** Shared devices in rural villages for inclusive education.
- **Teacher Dashboard:** Digital teaching tools for curriculum planning and student monitoring.
- **Secure Authentication:** Firebase/Auth0-based login and role-based access.
- **Scalable Backend:** Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB for efficient data management.
- **Cloud Integration:** AWS for storage and AI model hosting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
